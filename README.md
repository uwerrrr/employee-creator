## Demo & Snippets

- You can access the project by following this [link](https://oscar-employeecreator.onrender.com).
  - The frontend, backend and database are deployed using [render.com](https://render.com).
  - **Important**: The backend is deployed with a free tier, so the initial load may take up to 2 minutes if it's waking up from sleep mode.

### Tech stack:

- Front end:
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - React hook form
  - Yup (for form validation)
- Back end:
  - Spring Boot
  - Java
  - Spring Data JPA (for connecting backend to database)
  - mySQL (database)

## What Were My Challenges?

1. **Working with Yup Schema and TypeScript**:

   - Using the Yup schema library alongside TypeScript was a bit tricky. One issue was making sure that every object and input I used had the right interfaces defined. To simplify things, I tried to create reusable interfaces to avoid repeating myself.

2. **Finding a Wallet-Friendly Hosting Platform**:
   - When it came to deploying my backend, I struggled to find a platform that didn't break the bank. There weren't many free options available. After doing some research, I discovered render.com, which turned out to be budget-friendly. However, getting my backend to play nicely with Docker and PostgreSQL was another puzzle. To overcome this, I followed the steps in this [repository](https://github.com/TakiRahal/spring-boot-render/tree/main), and it helped me successfully deploy my project.
